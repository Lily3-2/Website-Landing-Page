                  <p>Heat Rash or Prickly Heat is properly known as Miliaria and is characterised by itchy red spots which typically develop on the chest, on the armpits and between the thighs in hot climates. It is caused by blocked sweat ducts which in turn lead to irritation and inflammation of sweat glands.</p>
